                    <h3 class="subHeading">■ About Me</h3>
                    <p>I am a project manager, a problem solver and a developer. I love tech and strongly believe tech should make our lives easier. Recently completed a web development bootcamp where I started from the basics moving on to JavaScript, Python and MySQL. I feel like a world of opportunities has opened up to me. I can experiment and build my own tools and apps. Unlock the power of the computer at my fingertip and expand my ability as a Project Manager. My long term desire is to combine Project Management and Full Stack Development into one.</p>
                    <hr>
                    <p>My career into project management started as innocent and serendipitous as could be. I had planned to learn iOS development but lacked the tools to test out any application I was creating at home (I did not own any iOS devices). I began calling up different agencies and startups asking for the opportunities. This proved fruitful and I was allowed to do a trial. Well, the trial didn't go as planned. I walked into a small office and the startup CEO was finishing up a call. While the two of us were talking another call came through the office phone. The CEO asked me "Would you mind taking this call for me? I already spoke with her and it didn't go well. Just find out what she wants and get her off the phone." So I nervously took the call. A client was on the other end of the call and wanted to give some feedback for the website she was reviewing. I politely asked for the details writing down each feedback. I looked back at the CEO and she sat there looking shocked. But what happened next surprised me. The startup CEO just straight up told me to look after this client and get this feedback implemented. I looked at him confused, he reiterated he does not want to chat with this client as the two of them don't get along. Little did I know my journey to becoming a project manager had just started.I've made this pretty long already but if you'd like to learn about my previous work experience I have detailed two different situations below.</p>
                    <hr>
                    <h4>■ Work Experience</h4>

                    <p>My past work experience has been focused on being a Project Manager. I had the privilege of working for some amazing agencies and various large brands. Working as a Project Manager was always a battle to bring order to chaos.</p>

                    <p>In my most recent role as a PM, I noticed a lot of the WordPress sites shared a lot of common components. To aid with both the design and development process I built a list of common components. I put together a design document detailing each common component and it's variations. ONce done I worked closely with the development team to build a Custom White Label WordPress Theme. Soon I found the whitelabel theme was being used for product demonstration with clients to explore and help define design requirements. Design team started using the Custom Theme to minimise scope creep. It also enabled the development team to focus on the unique development requirements. Ultimately the theme reduced risk across different project phases, reduced overall project time as well as improved project margins.</p>
                    <hr>
                    <p>Back During COVID-19 I found myself looking after an automotive client. While most teams were juggling with trying to figure out how to work remotely and manage their teams, for me it was a lot more straightforward. Being a Raid Leader and a Healer player of Final Fantasy XIV I was already experienced communicating and managing individuals of various backgrounds and skills over the internet. With everyone working from home I immediately realised all requirements had to be 100% clear with little room for assumptions. To facilitate this I changed the existing processes. To track the numerous requirements and be able to tell at a glance what needs to be worked on, what is being worked on, what tasks are assigned to which team members and client I set up a JIRA board to mimic the existing process the different teams were using. I then automated the workflow allowing JIRA tickets to automatically present a series of checklist items based on the ticket type and if completed the ticket would move along the process and get assigned to the next team member automatically. This reduced the need for my input at every stage and also reduced the chance of me being a bottleneck where tickets were waiting for me to approve and assign. Lastly I switched the project from having random duration for release to weekly sprints. The client had a large list of changes to be made and several changes required additional changes across the website and the involvement of the legal team. Furthermore, this change to weekly sprints enabled the team and I to quickly switch requirements and pause the work we were currently carrying out for sudden changes that came in unplanned mid-week. I can proudly claim that during the entire COVID-19 lockdown my team and I not only managed to deliver every all requirements on or ahead of deadline but, I was able to accelerate the start of other long term backend projects due to additional resources within the business being freed up. This led to 2 major projects being started and completed 6 months early. We migrated all of the clients .net API's over to Java, removing hte need to maintain and pary for MS Virtual Server, and upgrading all API's to v2 allowing additional features and automations.</p>
