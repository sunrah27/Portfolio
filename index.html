                    <h3 class="subHeading">■ About Me</h3>
                    <p>I am a project manager, a problem solver and a developer. I love tech and strongly believe tech should make our lives easier. Recently completed a web development bootcamp where I started from the basics moving on to JavaScript, Python and MySQL. I feel like a world of opportunities has opened up to me. I can experiment and build my own tools and apps. Unlock the power of the computer at my fingertip and expand my ability as a Project Manager. My long term desire is to combine Project Management and Full Stack Development into one.</p>
                    <hr>
                    <p>My career into project management started as innocent and serendipitous as could be. I had planned to learn iOS development but lacked the tools to test out any application I was creating at home (I did not own any iOS devices). I began calling up different agencies and startups asking for the opportunities. This proved fruitful and I was allowed to do a trial. Well, the trial didn't go as planned. I walked into a small office and the startup CEO was finishing up a call. While the two of us were talking another call came through the office phone. The CEO asked me "Would you mind taking this call for me? I already spoke with her and it didn't go well. Just find out what she wants and get her off the phone." So I nervously took the call. A client was on the other end of the call and wanted to give some feedback for the website she was reviewing. I politely asked for the details writing down each feedback. I looked back at the CEO and she sat there looking shocked. But what happened next surprised me. The startup CEO just straight up told me to look after this client and get this feedback implemented. I looked at him confused, he reiterated he does not want to chat with this client as the two of them don't get along. Little did I know my journey to becoming a project manager had just started.I've made this pretty long already but if you'd like to learn about my previous work experience I have detailed two different situations below.</p>
                    <hr>
                    <h4>■ Work Experience</h4>

                    <p>My past work experience has been focused on being a Project Manager. I had the privilege of working for some amazing agencies and various large brands. Working as a Project Manager was always a battle to bring order to chaos.</p>

                    <p>In my most recent role as a PM, I noticed a lot of the WordPress sites shared a lot of common components. To aid with both the design and development process I built a list of common components. I put together a design document detailing each common component and it's variations. ONce done I worked closely with the development team to build a Custom White Label WordPress Theme. Soon I found the whitelabel theme was being used for product demonstration with clients to explore and help define design requirements. Design team started using the Custom Theme to minimise scope creep. It also enabled the development team to focus on the unique development requirements. Ultimately the theme reduced risk across different project phases, reduced overall project time as well as improved project margins.</p>
                    <hr>
                    <p>During COVID-19, while everyone was trying to migrate to working from home I utilized my experience as a Raid Leader in Final Fantasy XIV to efficiently manage an automotive client remotely. Recognizing the need for clear communication and documentation, I revamped processes by implementing a JIRA board to track requirements and automate workflows, reducing bottlenecks. Weekly sprints were introduced to handle sudden changes and streamline project delivery. Despite the challenges, my team successfully met all deadlines, enabling the early completion of two major projects. This included migrating .NET APIs to Java, enhancing functionality and reducing costs.</p>
